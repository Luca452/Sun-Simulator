# Sun-Simulator
Sun Simulator used to test small size solar cells. In our case this is used to test Perovskites solar cells that are going to be mounted on the 6S CubeSat.

- Arduino nano programmed to control the LEDs light intensity through voltage controlled current generator.
- Temperature sensor used is LM35, which provides an analog output.
- Transimpedance amplifier used to measure the photodiode's signal.
